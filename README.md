# sql-challenge
## Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 9 Challenge

In this assignment, we were challenged to design a database using an entity relationship diagram (ERD) at first, then create those tables in pgAdmin, and finally write some SQL queries based on our tables. After inspecting the provided csv documents, I created an ERD using QuickDBD. In this, I included a few composite key for the tables that acted as transitions or indeces between the 'departments' and 'employees' tables. From there, I wrote a script ot create the tables in pgAdmin with the key components (pun intended) identified when mocking up the ERD. Finally, I wrote the SQL queries as requested in the assignment instructions on our [Canvas](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2866/assignments/45802?module_item_id=845582).
